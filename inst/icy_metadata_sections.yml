# icy template schema
#
# This file defines ALL template components for icy templates including
# header templates, data sections, and metadata sections. This centralizes
# the schema definition to ensure consistency across all icy functions.
#
# DO NOT modify this file unless you understand the implications.
# Changes here will affect template validation, YAML formatting,
# and all template-related functions throughout the package.

# Header templates for generated configuration files

    description:
      - "This section defines the standard configuration variables and their default values"
      - "that will be used when the package loads. Users can override these in their local"
